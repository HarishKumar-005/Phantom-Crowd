FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:checkDebugAarMetadata'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.CheckAarMetadataWorkAction
   > 2 issues were found when checking AAR metadata:
     
       1.  Dependency 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.17.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is currently compiled against android-35.
     
           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 36, for example 36.
     
           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.
